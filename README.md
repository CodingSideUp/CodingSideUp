Hi there! Taking a sneak peek at my profile, are we?
Well you can get to know everything about me you are looking for about me right here.
I am a current master's student studying my 2nd semester in Applied Data Science and Analytics at SRH HOCHSCHULE, HEIDELBERG.
Speaking about my past academics, I hold a Diploma and Bachelor's degree in Elecetronics and Communication and Telecommunications Engineering respectively.
I am a Data Science industry professional, with 4+ years of experience!
At the start of my professional career, I have worked as a Demand Analyst at GENPACT INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED.
During my capacity as a Demand Analyst, I have worked on Demand Forecasting of medical equipment for my clients GE Healthcare where I have built robust Machine Learning Algorithms to predict sales for specific time periods.
I have also worked on Data cleaning and wrangling, Data pre-processing and visualisation where I built dashboards and reports.
I then made the switch to my next company, VMWARE SOFTWARE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED as a Senior Analyst.
During my time here, I have worked on predicting sales of cloud products sold by the company for specific time periods.
I have again built robust ML models for the same.

Speaking of my general interests, I am genuinely interested in Machine Learning, MLOPS and Computer Vision as subjects. The fact that the technology of today is able to impact lives positively on a large scale is what imspires me to pursue tech as a career.
I come across as an optimistic individual, curious in nature with an insatiable thirst to learn new things and technologies, an out of the box thinker who always belives in adding value to his job by going above and beyond his usual work.
I am someone who I believe is technically good, who has an eye for the smallest of detail and a general knack of identifying patterns in just about anything.
I am also very much into sports and fitness, football in specific and I'm a huge fan of the Deutschland Fu√üball team in national teams and Real Madrid in clu football.
